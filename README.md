# Supertext Translation for Magnolia

Translate Magnolia pages into the other languages of their site with [Supertext](https://www.supertext.com) AI translation.

- **Translate with Supertext**: an action in the Pages app (page list and page editor) translates a page, its areas and components, and optionally its subpages, into the languages you tick. Existing translations are kept unless you choose to overwrite them.
- Translates every text and rich text field marked `i18n: true` in the page's and components' dialogs, composite fields included. Formatting and links stay intact. Translations are saved in the page's language versions (`title_de_CH` …), ready to review in the page editor and publish.
- **Supertext** app (app launcher → Translation): API key with a connection check, endpoint, form of address, language codes, excluded and additional fields.

Requires Magnolia 6.4 (Community Edition or DX Core, Java 17/21) and a Supertext API key: [create a Supertext account](https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin), then generate the key at [supertext.com → Integrations → API](https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api) (requires the Admin role).
